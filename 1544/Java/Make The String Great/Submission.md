Intuition
Whenever there were any adjacent letters in the mentioned format, deletion were to happen. So in a good/great string there will be no deletions happening.

Approach
My approach was to track these deletions and return the string only when there were no further deletions or the string is reduced to a single letter or to an empty string.
